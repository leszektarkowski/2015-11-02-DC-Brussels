<h3>Overview</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      When you're writing scripts or text, it's nice to have a text
      editor that is optimized for writing code, with features
      like automatic color-coding of key words.
      The default text editor on Mac OS X and Linux is usually set to Vim,
      which is not famous for being intuitive.
      if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it,
      try typing the escape key,
      followed by ':wq!' (colon, lower-case 'q', exclamation mark),
      then hitting Return
      to return to the shell. (This will exit Vim <b> and</b> save the changes you made in the file.)
    </p>
    <h4>The Bash Shell</h4>
    <p>
      Bash is a commonly-used command line interface, a so-called shell.
      Using a shell gives you
      the power to do more tasks more quickly by freeing you from having to click everything.

    <h4>R</h4>
    <p>
      R is a programming language that specializes in statistical
      computing. It is a powerful tool for exploratory data analysis. To
      interact with R, we will
      use <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, an interactive
      development environment (IDE).
    </p>
    <h4>SQL</h4>
    <p>
      SQL is a specialized programming language used with databases.
      We use a simple database manager called <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>,
      either directly or through a browser plugin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4>Spreadsheet</h4>
      We'll be using a spreadsheet program. If you already have a spreadsheet program
installed, like LibreOffice, Excel or OpenOffice, you can use whatever you already have.
If you don't have a spreadsheet program, please
<a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/">download</a>
and install LibreOffice.

<h3>Extras - everyone needs to install these</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <h4 id="firefox-sqlite">Firefox SQLite Plugin</h4>
    <p>
      Instead of using <code>sqlite3</code> from the command line,
      you will use <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/">this plugin</a>
      for Firefox instead. If you don't already have firefox, <a href="https://getfirefox.com">install</a> it first.
      To install the sqlite plugin:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Start Firefox.
      </li>
      <li>
	Go to the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/">plugin homepage</a>.

 Open Refine will open in the browser (but you don't have to be online)
    </p>

<h3>Spreadsheets</h3>

  <p>
    Spreadsheets are useful for data entry and data organization, and
some subsetting and sorting of the data as well as getting an overview of the data. To interact with spreadsheets, we can use
    <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org">LibreOffice</a>,
    <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/excel">Microsoft Excel</a>,
    <a href="http://www.gnumeric.org">Gnumeric</a>,
    <a href="https://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a>, or other programs.
  Commands may differ a bit between programs, but general ideas for thinking about spreadsheets is the same.

<p>
For this lesson, if you don't have a spreadsheet program already, you can use <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org">LibreOffice</a>. It's a free, open source spreadsheet program.
